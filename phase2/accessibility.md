**Universal Design Principles:**

Equitable Use:

All users use our program in the same way, we do not differentiate users through any means. In the future we can
design a GUI to make our program more appealing.

Flexibility in Use:

Our program can only be used in command line, and thus cannot provide more ways to use the program nor adapt to
user's pace. But in the future we can add a GUI to implement this Principle:

Simple and Intuitive Use:

Our program is easy to use, the only thing that user needs to do is input integers. Our in-app instructions are
clear, short, and easy to understand.

Perceptible Information:

Our messages have different colors so that user can easily distinguish different information, for example, in default
color settings we have warning messages in red, and we have welcome message in green. Users can also change their 
color setting.

Tolerance for Error:

In phase 2 we implemented a lot of tolerance for error, for example if user input a string in where they are supposed
to put an integer then our program will not crash, but a warning message will be sent out. Similarly, if user try to
do insensible actions like adding negative balance then the user will be warned.

Low Physical Effort:

Our program is easy to use, like mentioned above only integer input. We also have serialization for color settings 
so user will only have to change their color setting once, everytime they log in the UI automatically changes color
,so they don't have to repeat.

Size and Space for Approach and Use:

Our program cannot implement this principle because it uses command line, but in the future we can have a GUI and
give enough space to click so that users can use the program easily.


**Marketing:**

Our market targets are Grocery Stores and Supermarkets where they have a lot of users and with different kinds 
of customers, and is looking for a simple and easy to use program to facilitate their business, because our 
program is following the Clean Architecture and SOLID principles, it can be easily
maintained or extended by programmers who have only basic knowledge in java. For example if the store
wants to add more items
for sale they don't have to change any existing codes, all they have to do is to add this item into the
"Inventory.txt" file, and our gateway class will automatically detect this item. Our program also suites stores
with a lot of long term customers because it can store and load accounts so users only have to create their account
once, and our program is easy to use so even old people can use it without problems.
Our program can also be used 
by small stores that are in shortage of supply or are very popular, because our program can load and save orders, 
every purchase by an account will be stored so users can safely order items their want.

Our program is less likely to be used by stores that accepts cash. Although the payment system can be deleted but 
normally if a store does not accept online payment
then most likely then will not need a software like this. we are also not expecting stores that
do not have long term users like a small computer
store, most people buy a laptop and use it for over years, so there is no point to create an account and use a 
system like this to purchase a laptop, also most people want to take a look at the laptop they want to buy in
person, so they don't need a software.
