Scenario walkthrough: A user run the file 'store.java', when the program start, the user will see the main menu, and it
provides three choices, the user can either create an account or login to one, or can choose to exit the program.
When the program start, there is no account on record, so if a user choose to login to an account there will be 
error message highlighted in red. If a user choose to create an account then they can log in, and view a list of items 
in the store.
