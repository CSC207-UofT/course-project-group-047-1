Our project domain is a grocery order reservation app.

We are designing a program for grocery stores like Walmart or T&T. The program allows customers to register, login, and
order groceries from the store. The customers are able to view the name, price, and quantity in stock of each item.
They can also access their shopping cart, which allows them to add or delete grocery items from the cart, as well as to
view the total price of selected items. Customers are able to check out when they are ready, and they will be asked to
make the payment. Once the bill is received successfully, their order will be processed and available for pickup when
packing is completed.
